Please read the warning!

## WARNING: This is the very first version (0.0.1) of the grism ETC, and improvement is still underway. The current version demonstrates how to use the tool but changes in the specification files or the tool itself may occur and current results should be taken with caution.

Works with python 3.9.
Requirements are: "numpy", "matplotlib", "astropy", "spectres", "h5py", "fsps".

Once requirements have been installed and folder downloaded (or git cloned), install the grism ETC simply with:
> python setup.py install

/!\ Before installing the ETC, modify the 'ETC_GRISM_HOME' variable located in 'utils.py'. It should be the absolute path to the 'ETC_grism_dev' folder on your machine.
